````rust
//! A mostly lock-free multi-producer, single consumer queue.
//!
//! This module contains an implementation of a concurrent MPSC queue. This
//! queue can be used to share data between threads, and is also used as the
//! building block of channels in rust.
//!
//! Note that the current implementation of this queue has a caveat of the `pop`
//! method, and see the method for more information about it. Due to this
//! caveat, this queue might not be appropriate for all use-cases.

`#3`和`#4`是对同一个原子对象的release和acquire操作从而形成synchronization, 使得`#1` *happen-before* `#5`避免data race。而`#2`出的`Ordering::AcqRel`是为了让前一个`push`中的由`swap`产生的写和后一个`push`中由`swap`产的的读(其读取结果是`prev`)产生synchronization, 因为后一个`push`中对`pre`的写操作需要看到前一个`push`中`Node::new`,因为`pre`指向前一个`push`中`Node::new`的对象，因此需要前一个`push`中的`Node::new` *happens-before* 后一个`push`中对该memory location(即`pre`)的写，从而避免data race.
